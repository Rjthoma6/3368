# The coding below is part of the SQL connection clause that will help connect the database to python
# It allows a output statement to confirm that the Database has been connected correctly to python
# It also will give a statement if the connection is unsuccessful

# The coding below is to be able to send the written query in python to the SQL database
# If the query os successfully sent and accepted into the sql database it will display execute message or error

# The coding below goes with with the connection clause above it takes the information that is made with AWS
# and allows the cloud connection to the SQL database.
connection = create_connection("cis3368v2.cis8xwguc2c4.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com", "admin", "e1529378", "cis3368v2")

### The coding below asks for the user input of the state and date.
### The input was then used to parse into the json url which allows to pull the information from that date and states.

t=input("Enter the state for which the COVID data should be retrieved (e.g. TX):")
r=input("Enter the date for which the COVID data should be retrieved (e.g. 20201219):")
response = requests.get(" https://api.covidtracking.com/v1/states/"+t+"/"+r+".json")
c19_response= (response.json())

### The below coding takes the inputs that for the date and state and prints it.
print("State:%s"% (t))
print ("Date:%s"% (r))
###The code  below takes the full json data and filter it for the categorys postive,death,postiveincrease and death increase.
c19_positive=c19_response['positive']
print("Postive cases: %s" % (c19_positive))
c19_death=c19_response['death']
print("Death: %s" % (c19_death))
c19_pi=c19_response['positiveIncrease']
c19_di=c19_response['deathIncrease']
### the code below takes the information pulled from the json and the inputs and inserts it into the sql database
query = "INSERT INTO exam1 (date_, state,positiveIncrease,deathIncrease) VALUES('%s', '%s', '%s','%s')" % (
            r, t, c19_pi,c19_di)
execute_query(connection, query)
